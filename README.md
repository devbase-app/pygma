pygma is a Python tool that converts your Figma designs into functional Tkinter GUIsâ€”automatically. With a simple GUI built using Tkinter, pygma fetches your Figma design data via the Figma API, extracts frames and components, and then generates a basic, ready-to-run Tkinter UI. It's perfect for rapid prototyping and bridging the gap between design and development.

Features
Figma Integration:
Use your Figma API token and File ID to fetch your design data directly.

Automatic Frame Extraction:
Quickly extract frames and components from your Figma design for easy selection.

Tkinter UI Generation:
Automatically generate a basic Tkinter user interface based on your selected design frames.

Code Export:
Export the generated Python code for further customization or integration into your project.

User-Friendly GUI:
Enjoy an intuitive Tkinter-based interface that guides you through the process.
